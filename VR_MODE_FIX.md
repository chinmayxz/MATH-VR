# ✅ VR Mode Fix - Questions Now Visible!

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** When entering VR mode, the questions disappeared because they were 2D HTML overlays that don't show in VR.

**Solution:** Added 3D question panels that appear in the VR scene, fully clickable with VR controllers!

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Desktop Mode (2D)**
- Uses HTML popup overlays
- Click with mouse
- WASD to move around
- **Same as before** ✅

### **VR Mode (3D)**
- Uses 3D panels in A-Frame scene
- **Gaze cursor** (look at answer to select it)
- **Fuse time:** Look at an answer for 1.5 seconds to click
- VR controller trigger also works
- Joystick to move around
- **Questions now visible!** ✅

---

## 🔄 Automatic Mode Switching

The game now automatically:

1. **Detects when you enter VR mode**
   - Hides 2D HTML popup
   - Shows 3D VR panel
   - Loads current question into VR panel

2. **Detects when you exit VR mode**
   - Hides 3D VR panel
   - Shows 2D HTML popup
   - Preserves your progress

3. **Syncs both displays**
   - Both panels show same question
   - Both update when you answer
   - Score syncs across both
   - Progress preserved when switching modes

## 🎮 VR Controls

### **Looking & Moving**
- **Head Movement:** Look around naturally
- **Left Joystick:** Move forward/back/left/right
- **Right Joystick:** Snap turn (if needed)

### **Answering Questions**

- **OR Trigger:** Point and pull trigger to select
- **Green Reticle:** Shows where you're looking

### **Panel Control**
- **Look at "−" button:** Minimize panel (explore mountains!)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **New 3D Elements Added:**

1. **VR Cursor** (gaze-based)
   - Fuse timeout: 1.5 seconds
   - Green color (#4CAF50)
   - Points at clickable objects

2. **VR Question Panel** (a-entity)
   - Position: `0 2 -3` (in front of player)
   - 4×3 meter panel
   - Dark background with opacity
   - All text as a-text elements

3. **VR Answer Boxes** (4 clickable a-box)
   - Class: `.clickable .vr-answer`
   - Click handlers for VR controller
   - Color changes on correct/wrong

4. **VR Question Icon** (minimized state)
   - Green sphere with "?" text
   - Appears at `2 1.5 -2` (to the right)
   - Click to restore panel

### **JavaScript Logic:**

1. **VR Detection:**
```javascript
scene.addEventListener('enter-vr', () => {
  game.isVRMode = true;
  game.switchToVRMode();
});
```

2. **Dual UI Update:**
```javascript
// Update both 2D and 3D panels
showQuestion() {
  // Update HTML elements
  // Update VR a-text elements
  this.updateVRPanel();
}
```

3. **Unified Answer Checking:**
```javascript
checkAnswer(answer, button, index) {
  // Handle 2D button click (if button exists)
  // Handle 3D box click (if index exists)
  // Update both UIs accordingly
}
```
